# Editor Integration

Wagtail AI integrates with Wagtail's Draftail rich text editor to provide tools to help write content.

By default, it includes tools to:

* Run AI assisted spelling/grammar checks on your content
* Generate additional content based on what you're writing

You can also define your own prompts:

### Adding Your Own Prompts

Explore the `AI Prompts` settings, accessible via the Wagtail settings menu. Here you'll be able to view, edit and add new prompts.
