# Contributing to Wagtail AI

Thank you for considering to help Wagtail AI.

We welcome all support, whether on bug reports, code, reviews, tests, documentation, translations or just feature requests.

## Working on an issue

ðŸ‘‰ If an issue isnâ€™t being worked on by anyone, go for it! **No need to ask "please assign me this issue".** Add a comment to claim the issue once youâ€™re ready to start.

Always start work on issues or features by creating a new git branch from the most up-to-date `main` branch.
When ready, open a pull request with as detailed a description as possible, including a reference to the GitHub issue
number that the PR addresses or relates to. Use `Fixes #123`, `Closes #123` or `Addresses #123` when fixing an issue.
Use `Relates to #123` or `Part of #123` if addressing a small part of a multi-item issue.
