Wagtail AI integrates Wagtail with AI's APIs (think ChatGPT) to help you write and correct your content.

Right now, it can:

* Give you suggestions for titles and meta descriptions based on your page content
* Suggest titles and descriptions for your images
* Generate relevant alt text for your images based on both the image and surrounding page content
* Provide qualitative feedback on your content with actionable improvement suggestions
* Suggest related pages based on semantic similarity using vector embeddings
* Work with multiple LLM providers including local models, OpenAI, Mistral, Claude and many others
* Let you add your own custom prompts
* Correct your spelling/grammar
* Finish what you've started - write some text and tell Wagtail AI to finish it off for you

## Requirements & Costs

Wagtail AI supports [many different LLMs](https://wagtail-ai.readthedocs.io/latest/ai-providers/), with OpenAI models
available by default. To use these, you'll need an OpenAI account and an API key. There'll also be some cost involved.

For the OpenAI API used here (`gpt-3.5-turbo`), the [cost](https://openai.com/pricing) is

- $0.0005 per 1000 tokens for input tokens (prompt)
- $0.0015 per 1000 tokens for output tokens (answer)

Here is an estimated cost breakdown for the `correction` prompt on a 1000-word paragraph.

### We assume that:

- Prompt is 30 words and the existing paragraph is 1000 words (Input)
- Each word is 1.3 tokens (Tokens multiplier)
- We get back 1000 words back (Output)

### Then:

- **Input tokens :** (35 + 1000) x 1.3 = 1345.5 tokens.
- **Output tokens :** 1000 x 1.3 = 1300
- **Input tokens cost :** 1345.5 / 1000 * $0.0005 = $0.00067275
- **Output tokens cost :** 1300 / 1000 * $0.0015 = $0.00195
- **Total cost :** $0.00262275
